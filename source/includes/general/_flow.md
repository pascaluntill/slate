# unTill API Flow

Idea: Provide any kind of description how unTill and our API works, to give the 3rd party developer an idea about the product.

* 3rd party software calls SOAP functions, provided by unTill Server
* unTill Server communicates to a special instance of unTill.exe which runs in background
* unTill.exe performs the required actions and sends back the results
