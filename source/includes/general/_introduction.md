Welcome to the TPAPI-POS API! unTill Server provides a SOAP interface for 3rd party applications which may be used for remotely working with POS: reading configuration, making orders, etc.: TPAPI-POS API.

You can view code samples in the dark area to the right, and switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right (currently we have only XML available but we might add more later).
